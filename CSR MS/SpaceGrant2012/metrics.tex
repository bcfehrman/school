The following lists the specific metrics to define the success of the research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Develop recurrent neural network for object recognition in point cloud data

\item Show that the neural network will can learn based upon new information

\item See that the newly developed solution performs better in terms of accuracy and speed than the current algorithms 

\end{itemize}
