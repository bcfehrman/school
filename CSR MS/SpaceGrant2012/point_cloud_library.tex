The Point Cloud Library, or \emph{PCL}, is a large scale, stand alone, and open source project for both 2D and 3D point cloud processing. The PCL contains many advanced image processing functions such as 3D point cloud stitching and object recognition. Devices using the OpenNI 3D (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) interface can send their data to a program  for processing via the PCL.
