The first and foremost activity will be an in depth literature review of the past and present research on point cloud data. This will include not only object recognition algorithms, but also more low level routines such as edge detection, segmentation, and other topics that could be beneficial. Research will be conducted on recurrent neural networks and methods for training them such as evolutionary techniques. Since intelligence and biological concepts underlie all of this it will also be worth while to take a closer look at how humans recognize objects and perceive their environment as this sort of view can often give great insight. The algorithms developed will be tested using simulations and a natural interface sensor and performance will be compared to existing approaches.
