Awarding a Space Grant stipend for this research will directly address, among other goals, the SDSGC Objective B.2.2 and Strategy B.2.2.3 by supporting multi-disciplinary graduate research that is aligned with NASA's mission since this technology could be very valuable to autonomous robots in space. This stipend will assist in the research by allowing me to better focus on the work at hand without external financial concerns. Good results from this could jump start my career into the STEM disciplines which is something that I have always sought after. My love of what I do makes me a natural fit for the field which could lead to great accomplishments such as owning a successful business that can continue to provide funds for exciting and useful research.
