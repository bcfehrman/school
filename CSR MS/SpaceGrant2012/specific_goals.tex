The OUR-CVFH algorithm previously described is essentially constrained to a static set of data on which it was trained. This would limit a robot in terms of its ability to adapt and learn in environments where information is encountered that has not previously been seen. The goal here is to investigate the use of Recurrent Neural Networks to identify objects within a scene and to also update their knowledge by providing some sort of a reward or fitness function to sway the decisions to be more accurate. The outcome would be improved robustness over the existing state of the art in terms of object detection within a cluttered, noisy, unpredictable environment.
