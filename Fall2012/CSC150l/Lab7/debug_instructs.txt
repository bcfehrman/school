  Program: 1_Looper.cpp
  Course: CSC150
  Date: 10/19/10
  Description:
    Bad loop control.  The loop should end when the counter
    reaches 20.  You will find that the program just keeps 
    on going and going and going......

    DEBUGGING TECHNIQUE
    A technique used for debugging is to place cout statements
    after a variable is modified. Since this program just keeps on
    going, cout statements won't be very useful.  (Use ctrl-c to
    stop it!) Step thru the program using the Debug options 'Run to
    Cursor' and 'Step Over' to trace thru the program. Look for the 
    point where the loop should stop and determine why it doesn't. 
    Note that you can highlight the condition in the while() 
    statement, then hover your mouse over the highligted text to 
    see what it evaluates to (true or false).  Correct the code
	so it does stop at 7 loops/iterations.

* File: Chap_7_Debugging.cpp
*
* General Instructions: Complete each step before proceeding to the 
* next.
*
* Debugging Exercise 1
*
* 1) Insert a breakpoint on the lines indicated in the code. 
* 2) Run to Breakpoint 1.
* 3) When prompted, enter your age.
* 4) When the execution stops, add a watch on age and verify that
*    the value in age is what you typed in.
* 5) Step over the if statement.
* 6) Why did the value in age change? 
* 7) Fix the problem and repeat Steps 2  5 to verify the
*    problem was corrected.
* 8) Stop debugging.
* 
* Debugging Exercise 2
*
* 1) Run to Breakpoint 1. 
* 2) When prompted, enter the value 25 for your age.
* 3) Step over the if statement. Execution of the program should
*    continue on the else if statement.
* 4) Verify that 25 is still stored in age.
* 5) Step over the else if.
* 6) Why is the program going to print "Teenager" for an age of 25?
* 7) Fix the problem and repeat Steps 1  5 to verify the
*    problem was corrected.
* 8) Stop debugging.
* 9) Remove Breakpoint1.
*
* Debugging Exercise 3
*
* 1) Run the program without debugging.
* 2) When prompted, enter the value of 10 for your age.
* 3) Why does the program print both "Child" and "Adult"?
* 4) Re-run the program this time with debugging and run to 
*    Breakpoint 2.
* 5) Why is the action with the else executing?
* 6) Fix the problem and re-run to verify the problem was corrected.
