  Description:
    Bad loop control.  The loop should end when the counter
    reaches 20.  You will find that the program just keeps 
    on going and going and going......

    DEBUGGING TECHNIQUE
    A technique used for debugging is to place cout statements
    after a variable is modified. Since this program just keeps on
    going, cout statements won't be very useful.  (Use ctrl-c to
    stop it!) Step thru the program using the Debug options 'Run to
    Cursor' and 'Step Over' to trace thru the program. Look for the 
    point where the loop should stop and determine why it doesn't. 
    Note that you can highlight the condition in the while() 
    statement, then hover your mouse over the highligted text to 
    see what it evaluates to (true or false).  Correct the code
	so it does stop at 7 loops/iterations.
