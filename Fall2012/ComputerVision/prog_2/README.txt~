Computer Vision Prog 2
Brian Fehrman

COMPILE
------------
From within the prog_2 directory, the program should be able to be compiled with a simple:

make clean
make all

You may need to edit the directories in the make file. This command will simply use
prog_2.cpp as the compile target which is actually a "unity" compile file.

RUN
---------------
From the top menu
