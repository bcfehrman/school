Everything should be self contained in the Prog1 folder.
The executable is in bin, source code in src, data files in data,
and build files in build. 

Run the executable from the Prog1 directory (vs inside the source).
If you don't run from the Prog1 directory then make sure
to pass in the correct path to the data file as a program
argument.

Example from Prog1 directory using data file in default location:

	./bin/prog1

Example from Prog1/bin directory

	./prog1 ../data/prog1_data.txt

If you need to rebuild the source then from inside
the Project1 directory you should be able to just call

	make clean
	make all

If your c++ files are elsewhere besides /usr/include and /usr/lib
then you will need to edit the Makefile accordingly.

The program will output the xy position and theta pose data
to the screen and to a file that should be in the same directory
as the input file (data folder by defaulta) and with the same name 
except with _out.txt at the end of it.

I created a simple Matlab script (plot_prog1.m) to read in the output 
data from the output file, plot it, then save it to and eps file format.
I don't haven't figured out yet how to do a directed plot in Matlab
but since we know the starting and end position you can trace the path
of the robot by looking at the graph. The Matlab script is in the src 
folder and it outputs the plot to the data folder.
