//Teacher: Dr. Corwin
//Program: Program 1
//Due Date: 11/9/2012 midnight
//
//This program will take a data file with data points on
//each line which should be whitespace seperated values
//that are in the form "feat_1_val feat_2_val ... feat_n_val class_num".
//Optional command line arguments are number of classes and number
//of features per class. This program will run mahalanobis classfier,
//mle classifier, and knn classifier with k=1 and then k=3. The summary
//of each classifier are displayed in the console.
//
//The program is very close to be able to handle an arbitrary number
//of features for each class but is not quite there and currently
//handles 2. MLE is really the only one that will not work for
//n features -- mahalanobis and knn classifiers should work.
//This just has to do with the determinant term used in the MLE.
