//This is the "unity" file for Program 1
//Just use this file as the build target
//in the makefile which has already been done so
//a simple "make all" from within the prog_1
//directory should do it. May need to change
//include directories in the makefile to match 
//your system

#include "ann.cpp"
#include "prog_2_main.cpp"
