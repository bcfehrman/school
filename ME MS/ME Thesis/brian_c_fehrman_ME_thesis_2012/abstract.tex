A large number of micro-meteoroids speed towards the earth each day. In addition, a substantial amount of debris orbits the earth. Lightweight space structures and satellites are often at the mercy of these speeding objects. Collision is not always avoidable and surface damage is almost inevitable which is very costly to repair once it occurs. Self healing materials that can automatically repair themselves once damaged are of interest to this area. The healing process is in competition with the crack expansion process and it may be necessary to accelerate the healing process in order to achieve sufficient mechanical recovery. Focused acoustic energy is one theorized way to increase the recovery rate. Time reversal signal processing is an algorithm which can focus acoustic energy at an arbitrary crack location. In this work, time reversal acoustic focusing in one dimension at a defect with an unknown location was explored. It was shown that the time reversal process is able to achieve a localized focusing of acoustic stress waves at a crack location in both nylon and steel rods. The experimental results were compared with theoretical calculations and a decent match was seen. Crack detection tests were also performed and it was shown that the program could detect when damaged occurred within the system.
