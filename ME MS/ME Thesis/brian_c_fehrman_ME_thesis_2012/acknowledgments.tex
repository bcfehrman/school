First and foremost I would like to thank my wife Jaida for her love and unconditional support for my educational endeavors. She has been there for me every step of the way which made my work all that much better.

I'm grateful for my family members who have given much needed encouragement.

Dr. Umesh Korde has been instrumental in my work. His great insight, understanding, and patience has enabled me to make progress in my research. He has also taught me valuable lessons which have helped to shape me professionally and these lessons will be remembered throughout my career.

I give great thanks to Jeremy Banik, Jeffrey Welsh, and the AFRL Space Vehicles Directorate for their generous financial support which, among many other things, has helped purchase equipment that was absolutely necessary for the tests performed.

The South Dakota School of Mines is also owed thanks because without them none of this would have been possible for me.

Lastly, I would like to thank all of my wonderful colleagues at the Advanced Dynamics Laboratory for both their help and friendship. Miles Wickersham and Andy Downs gave excellent help with designing and building circuits. Alex Cushman, Eric Peterson, and Katherine Barnes performed great supporting experiments that helped motivate my work. Jeff Comrie, Tyler Engberg, and Michael Fontaine provided wonderful insight to different aspects of the experimental setups.
