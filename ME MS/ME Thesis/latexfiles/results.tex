%Results

In this chapter the results from each of the experiments are detailed. Signals that were read with and without using the diode circuit are shown. The experimental results for the single iteration time reversal algorithm are compared with the theoretical results from the model described earlier. The crack detection and iterative focusing results are also examined.

\section{Diode Damping Circuit}
It was found experimentally that the amplifier circuits used produced enough noise to be a nuisance during testing. To address this problem a simple diode circuit was designed to snuff out low voltage noise at the expense of reduced output amplitude. The voltage damping is due to the voltage drop that occurs across the diode which effectively blocks voltages lower than about $0.8V $ for the diodes chosen. A nylon rod section of $148 mm$ was used for the test. PZT A sent a signal and PZT B recorded. The results with and without the diode circuit are compared in Figure \ref{fig:diodeCircuitResults}. It was seen the using the diode circuit produced a much cleaner signal recording.

\section{Crack Detection Results}
The crack detection experiments were to prove that the program could detect when damage occurred within a rod. Signals were sent from PZT A and propagated through the rod where they were recorded on the other end by PZT B. The first set of tests were performed using the steel rods. The graphs of the undamaged and damaged rod tests are shown in Figure \ref{fig:steelCrackResults}. It is seen that the wave recorded by PZT B during the damaged rod tests is substantially smaller in amplitude than the wave that is recorded in the undamaged rod tests. The tests were run five times for both the undamaged and damaged samples. The signal recorded for the first test for the undamaged rod was taken to be the initial rod state. The remaining nine test signals were then compared to this first signal to determine the change in signal which was taken as the sum of squared differences between the signals being compared. The results from each comparison are shown in Figure \ref{fig:steelDifferences} where the damaged rod is introduced on the 6th iteration. It is seen that there is a very large jump in the computed signal difference when the damaged rod signal data is introduced.

The same tests were performed using nylon rods. Figure \ref{fig:nylonCrackResults} shows the graphs for both the undamaged and damaged nylon rod crack detection tests. As with the steel rods, a large change in amplitude is seen from the undamaged to the damaged signals. Figure \ref{fig:nylonDifferences} shows the sum of squared differences for each iteration of the nylon rod tests with the damaged rod again being introduced on the 6th iteration. Just as with the steel rods a large jump in the graph is seen when the damaged rod is introduced.

\section{Single Iteration Time Reversal Results}

\subsection{Steel Rods Single Iteration Results}
Theoretical calculations were carried out for the first iteration of the one dimensional time reversal focusing algorithm using the equations described in the modeling section of this thesis. Time reversal focusing was desired to be at the 'defect' PZT with a multi-tone signal over the frequency range of $100 kHz$ - $130 kHz$. The calculations were carried out assuming that there was zero dissipation. Figures \ref{fig:steelThExp1} - \ref{fig:steelThExp3} show the theoretical and experimental results together for each of the three steel rod combinations that were tested. A reasonable match between the results is seen but differences arise due to the calculations not accounting for dispersion or dissipation. The amplitude of the experimental waves are seen to have lower amplitude and an altered shape from the waves seen in the theoretical results. The wave recorded in the time reversal phase was seen to be larger than the response recorded in the interrogatory phase and was the desired result as this implied a focusing of the energy from each wave at the defect location.

\end{figure}

 \subsection{Nylon Rods Single Iteration Results}
 Calculations were also carried out for the nylon rods which was also based upon the models seen previously in this paper. The calculations for the nylon rods also ignored dispersion and dissipation. As with the steel rods, these theoretical results were compared with the experimental results and this comparison is shown for each of the three nylon rod tests Figures \ref{fig:nylonThExp1} - \ref{fig:nylonThExp3}. A worse match is seen in these experiments and is perhaps due to greater dispersion and dissipation within the nylon rods than seen in the steel rods. The overall result was still good though because the wave in the time reversal phase wass again seen to be larger than the wave recorded in the interrogatory phase. This increase in amplitude showed that focusing occurred with the nylon rod tests.

 \section{Iterative Time Reversal Results}
 The time reversal algorithm was applied iteratively in both the steel and nylon rod tests. The goal of the iterative reversal was to see an increase in the response amplitude at the defect with each iteration. For each iteration the amplitude gain at the defect was recorded and used to determine the overall effectiveness of applying the time  reversal algorithm in an iterative fashion. The gain was determined by comparing the max peak to peak amplitude recorded at the defect on each iteration with the max response recorded on the first iteration. The max peak to peak amplitude was taken to be $|max(DefectVoltage) - min(DefectVOltage)|$. The gain was then computed as $CurrentMax / InitialMax$ and this was plotted for each time reversal iteration. 
 
 \subsection{Steel Rods Multiple Iteration Results}
 For the steel rod tests it was seen that the amplitude of the gain increased rapidly in the beginning of the experiments as the algorithm found a better and better signal with each iteration for the PZTs to playback. The gain began to level off as the number of iterations increased and the algorithm started to converge on a playback signal for each PZT. In the gain plots for the three steel rod tests it is seen that the gain increased substantially in the beginning and then leveled out (Figures \ref{fig:steelIter1} - \ref{fig:steelIter3}). It was noticed that the final gain seen may not necessarily have been the maximum gain achieved throughout the iterative process. This suggests that further refinements could be made to the time reversal algorithm such that the optimal playback waves would be found, and also suggests that more descriptive models are needed to further understand the underlying principles of time reversal.

\caption{Defect amplitude gain on each iteration for the $437 mm$ and $428 mm$ steel rod iterative time reversal test with a final gain of about 3.
  	 \label{fig:steelIter3}} 
\end{figure}

 
 The other method used to gauge the performance of the iterative time reversal was to compare the signature of the response at the defect on both the first and last iteration. If the algorithm worked correctly then what should have been seen is that the final wave was purer and of larger amplitude than the initial wave. This is in fact what was seen in the steel rod tests. The comparison of the first and initial waves at the defect are shown for each of the three steel rod tests in Figures \ref{fig:steelExp1} - \ref{fig:steelExp3}.

 \subsection{Nylon Rods Multiple Iteration Results}
 As with the steel rod tests, the amplitude gain seen at the defect on each iteration was plotted for the three nylon rod tests (Figures \ref{fig:nylonIter1} - \ref{fig:nylonIter2}). With the nylon rods an even higher gain was seen than with the steel rod tests. The nylon tests showed an average gain of over 3 whereas the gains seen with the steel rod tests were closer to 2. The first and final waves recorded at the defect are also compared for each of the nylon tests and these results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nylonExp1} - \ref{fig:nylonExp3}. It was seen that final wave was of much greater amplitude than the initial wave for all of the tests performed.
