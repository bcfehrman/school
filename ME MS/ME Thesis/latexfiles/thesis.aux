Some examples of debris objects include: broken spacecraft, upper stages of launch vehicles, debris that is intentionally released from missions, debris from collisions, and paint flecks. Much of the debris seems benign due to its size but is made dangerous by its high velocity (up to $60 km/s$/s for smaller pieces). \newline  imagesource:[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/photogallery/beehives/GEO640.jpg] }}{2}}
