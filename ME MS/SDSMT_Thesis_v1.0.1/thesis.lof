\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Image from NASA which depicts the debris objects that are currently orbiting the Earth. Some examples of debris objects include: broken spacecraft, upper stages of launch vehicles, debris that is intentionally released from missions, debris from collisions, and paint flecks. Much of the debris seems benign due to its size but is made dangerous by its high velocity (up to 60km/s for smaller pieces). \newline imagesource:[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/photogallery/beehives/GEO640.jpg] }}{2}

The drawing depicts the stages of damage, fluid release, and polymerization. \newline source:[http://www.howstuffworks.com/self-healing-spacecraft1.htm] }}{4}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces a)A transducer sends an acoustic wave through a medium and a transducer on the opposite end records the response. This material is seen without a defect and the simulated response is shown; b) Same as a), but a defect is now present in the medium which causes a change in the response recorded on the opposite end and is seen in the simulated recorded response. }}{6}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.4}{\ignorespaces Concept drawing of time reversal in one dimension; a) An initial wave is sent out by a transducer; b) The wave travels down the rod until it hits the crack and splits into multiple components; c) The components of the incident wave travel towards each transducer where they are recorded; d) The recorded signals are amplified and replayed in a time reversed fashion; e) The wave components simultaneously reach the crack location where they first split and combine to cause a focusing of their amplitude at that point. }}{8}
