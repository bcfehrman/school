%  article.tex (Version 3.3, released 19 January 2008)
%  Article to demonstrate format for SPIE Proceedings
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the
%  symbol %>>>>
%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, e.g., to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class 
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst, 
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.  

%\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper
\documentclass[a4paper]{spie}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing 
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images 
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX 
%  installations. 
\usepackage[]{graphicx}

\title{Experiments on the focusing and use of acoustic energy to accelerate polymer healing} 

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the 
%  author list and their institutions.  Use  \skiplinehalf 
%  to separate author list from addresses and between each address.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript in italics, 
%  which is easily obtained with \supit{}.

\author{Alexander J. Cushman\supit{a}, Brian C. Fehrman\supit{a}, Shaun D. Gruenig\supit{a}, and Umesh A. Korde\supit{a}

%>>>> Further information about the authors, other than their 
%  institution and addresses, should be included as a footnote, 
%  which is facilitated by the \authorinfo{} command.

\begin{abstract}
This document shows the desired format and appearance of a manuscript prepared for the Proceedings of the SPIE.  It contains general formatting instructions and hints about how to use LaTeX.  The LaTeX source file that produced this document, {\tt article.tex} (Version 3.3), provides a template, used in conjunction with {\tt spie.cls} (Version 3.3).

%%  Use following command to specify that graphics file is in 
%%  a directory other than this LaTeX source file.
%%  Note use of / to separate subdirectories, for UNIX and Windows OS.
%%\graphicspath{{H:/HANSON/SPIESTY/}}
%% tabular environment useful for creating an array of images  
%-------------
%   \begin{figure}
%   \begin{center}
%   \begin{tabular}{c}
%   \includegraphics[height=7cm]{mcr3b.eps}
%   \end{tabular}
%   \end{center}
%   \caption[example] 
%%>>>> use \label inside caption to get Fig. number with \ref{}
%   { \label{fig:example} 
%Figure captions are used to describe the figure and help the reader understand it's significance.  The caption should be centered underneath the figure and set in 9-point font.  It is preferable for figures and tables to be placed at the top or bottom of the page. LaTeX tends to adhere to this standard.}
